Callan isn't doing too hot on p2 for cs400. He struggles and is up for 2 nights straight.
Even with 2 night of no sleep, he only gets half way done.
Finally, on the 3rd night, thanks to a bunch of red bull and coffee, Callan finishes p2.;

Once he finishes P2 he decides to go to the Badger basketball game and at halftime is picked to attempt the half court shot. After he goes down to the court and is handed the ball he makes the shot! 

The Crowd goes wild and he gets his reward. But it's only a 10$ concessions gift card.

But good ol' humble Callan accepts his reward with a smile and lived hapilly ever after. The end.
